# Invigilation Using Lightweight Semantic Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a vision-based invigilation system designed to enhance examination security through **lightweight semantic analysis**. The project utilizes **Swin Transformer Tiny** for semantic segmentation and **ShuffleNet V2** for facial recognition, providing an efficient, scalable solution for detecting examination cheating.

## üìú Overview

### Key Features
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Designed to operate efficiently on edge computing devices, making it suitable for use in constrained environments such as examination halls.
- **High Accuracy Models**:
  - **Semantic Segmentation with Swin-T**: Achieves **92.74% accuracy** for precise object boundary detection.
  - **Facial Recognition with ShuffleNet V2**: Attains **98.58% accuracy** in verifying student identities.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Capable of handling complex scenarios like multiple students or various types of unauthorized items, both in traditional and computer-based exam settings.

### Abstract
The project presents a system that integrates advanced **deep learning models** to effectively monitor students during examinations and detect cheating behaviors. The lightweight architecture is optimized for **edge deployment**, combining powerful deep learning tools to provide real-time detection of unauthorized activities while minimizing computational overhead.

## üìÇ Datasets
- **Classification Dataset**: A proprietary dataset comprising images from **13 individuals**, each contributing 30 photographs. We used **MTCNN** for facial feature extraction, significantly improving model convergence.
- **Segmentation Dataset**: We utilized the **CHIP-19 dataset** containing comprehensive human body information for training our Swin Transformer model.

## üîç Methodology
- **ShuffleNet V2**:
  - A lightweight convolutional neural network used for **identity classification**.
  - Features an architecture optimized for resource-constrained devices, maintaining a memory footprint of only **36.87 MB**.
- **Swin Transformer Tiny (Swin-T)**:
  - A vision transformer designed for **semantic segmentation**, utilizing **shifted window-based self-attention** to accurately detect object boundaries.
  - Suitable for both **fixed** and **dynamic camera setups**, making it versatile for examination environments.

### Decision-Level Fusion
To enhance system performance, **decision-level fusion** was implemented:
- **Segmentation Model**: Responsible for delineating distinct objects, such as arms and unauthorized items.
- **Classification Model**: Focuses on identifying student identities, especially in scenarios where individual actions need to be correlated with identity.

This separation improves overall system efficiency and minimizes model complexity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Setup
The system operates in two examination environments:
1. **Computer-Based Exams**:
   - Requires only **basic camera** and **6GB RAM**.
   - Monitors identity through periodic face verification and detects **contraband** such as earphones or smartphones.
2. **Traditional Exams**:
   - Utilizes both **fixed and dynamic cameras** to capture contraband and student movements.
   - A dynamic camera, often mounted on a **robot**, navigates to monitor the entire room.

## üìä Results
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Achieved high accuracy in delineating full human bodies and detecting hands in real-time.
- **Facial Classification**: ShuffleNet V2 effectively identified students in examination scenarios, even with limited training data.

## üí° Applications
This project has significant implications for:
- **Educational Environments**: Increasing exam security by minimizing manual monitoring needs and reducing cheating incidents.
- **Edge Computing**: Demonstrates the potential for using deep learning models in constrained environments where **computational efficiency** is critical.
